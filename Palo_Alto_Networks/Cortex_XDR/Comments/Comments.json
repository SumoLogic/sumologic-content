  "review":"This is a good dashboard to have an overview into the cortex xdr app. This app provides visibility into the alerts by severity, category along with providing trends over time. I also have ability to filter with host name, host ip and alert id. There is also a scheduled search which can be setup to send as a signal to the CSE environment."
