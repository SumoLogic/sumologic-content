// A list of all possible health events can be found in documentation. 
// There is one docs site per sumo instance for example au (all instance docs are identical): 
// https://service.au.sumologic.com/audit/docs/#tag/Health-Events-(System)

// EXAMPLE: include or exclude  certain know collectors or sources
// | where resource_name matches /(?i)include_regular_expression/
// | where !(resource_name matches /(?i)exclude_regular_expression/)

// EXAMPLE: exclude some installed collector events that can be very chatty in larger environments using auto scaling.
// | where ! (error IN ("Installed collector and its sources are offline","File Collection Error","Failed to connect to the event channel"))
