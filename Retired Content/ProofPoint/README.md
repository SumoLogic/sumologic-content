  - This syslog forwarding do requires syslog over TLS so setting up a syslog-ng or rsyslog to accepted encrypted syslog is required.

  There is also an SIEM API method that can be customized to extract data from Proofpoint into Sumo Logic, but that is not in scope for this App (https://help.proofpoint.com/Threat_Insight_Dashboard/API_Documentation/SIEM_API).
