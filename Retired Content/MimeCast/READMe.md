Contains all MimeCast product lines for which Sumo Logic has content for.

See [Sumo Logic Documentation](https://help.sumologic.com/) for instructions on how to collect logs and metrics for use with content.
**In addition, for MimeCast log collection, please refer to SumoLogic-Data-Collection-for-MimeCast.pdf in this repo**

To use the content:

1. Collect MimeCast MTA and Audit logs with scripts located in the SumoLogic Mimecast Data Collection folder.
2. Download the raw JSON file(s) and search for (CTRL+F / CMD+F) "$$Mimecast" to replace with your "_sourceCategory=yourSourceCategory".

Guidelines PLEASE READ:

To contribute to subfolders or create new subfolders here, please follow the standards below:

1. All application, dashboard and search content in .json format. Please use descriptive naming such as:
   a. Company_TechnologyLine_ContentFunction. E.g. AWS_Kinesis_Errors.json or Sentinel_Vanguard_All.json

2. Relevant screenshot(s) in .png or equivalent format. Naming similar or equivalent to .json content it represents.

3. Create/update a README.md file (like this one) within the folder to track:
   a. Technology and product lines, authors, versions, etc.
   b. Link(s) to relevant 3rd party documentation to specify what types of data need to be collected for content to work.
