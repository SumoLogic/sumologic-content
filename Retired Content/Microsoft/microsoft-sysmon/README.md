## Content
The Sysmon package `microsoft-sysmon.json` contains individual queries and dashboards for the following:
* All Sysmon event IDs (1 to 255), including 22 (DNSEvent) and 23 (FileDelete) introduced recently
* Threat Intel correlation (via Crowdstrike Threat Intel feed)
* Threat Hunting (via custom lookup for IP, DOMAIN and file HASH)

All dashboards and queries contain a `pre` and a `post` filter (search parameters):
* `pre` filter can be used to quickly filter events based on the content. This is added to the scope of the search query and will match any string contains anywhere in the event. This field is case insensitive and wildcards can be used.
* `post` filter is added after all parsing (but before the last grouping in dashboard panels), so you can extended the query (for example, using `| where rulename="RDP"`). For individual queries, this can be used to modify the output quickly (for example: `| count as Total Computer`).

## Installation
1. Download `microsoft-sysmon.json`
2. Using a text editor, search for the string `**TO_REPLACE**` and replace with the source category for Sysmon data (for example: `prod/windows/*`).
3. Before importing content, you need to create the IOC lookup by running the following command:
```* | limit 1
| "127.0.0.1" as ioc
// ioc_type: IP, DOMAIN, SHA256, MD5
// DOMAIN entries should be in lowercase
// SHA265 and MD5 can be in lowercase or uppercase (but not both)
| "IP" as ioc_type
| "Custom" as ioc_source
| "This is a for testing only" as ioc_description
| count ioc, ioc_type, ioc_source, ioc_description
| fields -_count
| save shared/threat_hunting/iocs
```
4. Import content in Sumologic library
5. Enjoy!

### Threat Hunting
In order to use the custom Threat Hunting dashboard, IOCs must be added into the lookup `shared/threat_hunting/iocs`.
IOC type must be: `IP`, `DOMAIN`, `SHA256` or `MD5`.

1. To create the lookup for the first IOC, open the query called `1- Create IOCS lookup (shared/threat_hunting/iocs)`.
2. To add a new entry into that lookup, open the query called `2- Add new entry in IOCS lookup (shared/threat_hunting/iocs)`
3. To list the content of the lookup, open the query called `3- List content of IOCS lookup (shared/threat_hunting/iocs)`
