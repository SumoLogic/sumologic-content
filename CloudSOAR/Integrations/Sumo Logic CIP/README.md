This integration is in active development. Actions, or the parameters defined therin may change in subsequent releases.

## To use the content:
- Download the Integration and Action YAML files to your local device.

- Add any Actions you downloaded to that Integration by selecting the Upload icon (hover over the newly added integration), and uploading the Action YAML file(s).
- For more information on uploading custom Integrations/Actions and how to test them, please see [Working with integrations](https://help-opensource.sumologic.com/docs/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-integration-framework/#working-with-integrations).

## Action Descriptions 
### Threat IP Search
- Accepts a single IP, or comma-separated list of IPs and searches for IOCs using Sumo Logic's [threatip()](https://help-opensource.sumologic.com/docs/search/search-query-language/search-operators/threatip/ operator. 
  - **IP Addresses** - IP Address(es) (single or comma-separated) to search for using "threatip()" search operator (e.g. "0.0.0.0, 0.0.0.0" or manually input each IP and hit 'enter').
    - Tip: The Automation Tools > "Render Textarea Field" action would be useful here to "build" a list of IPs composed of a series of JSON placeholders.
  - **Source Category** - If no source category is provided, a wildcard ("*") will be used.
  - **Malicious Confidence** - Filter the results returned by malicious confidence (e.g. "low", "medium", "high", "unverified"). If none specified, all results are returned.
  - **Time Range (Relative)** - How far back to search for results. If none specified, the default is 15 minutes)
