### Add External Alert to Incident
- Takes a JSON payload and attaches to a Cloud SOAR incident's "External Alert" section.

### Get External Alert
- Fetches the external alert(s) attached to an incident

  - _Note: You will need to specify yaml output mappings for each external alert you wish to fetch in order for this action to be usable within a playbook._

### Add Entity Metadata
- Searches for the specified entity object (IP, URL, etc.), locates the entity's ID first, and then adds a tag and/or description to this entity.

### Get War Room Timeline
- Grabs the Incident's audit timeline and returns it in JSON format. This is useful for posting to a CIP HTTP source (using 'Generic HTTP POST' action)

### Generic HTTP POST
- Make a generic POST request.
- Usage:
  - **API URL** - The HTTP Endpoint to make the request to.
  - **Request Body as JSON** - a _textarea_ field to build a JSON result using placeholders.
  - **Request Body (output.raw JSON)** - accepts the raw JSON result from the output of a previous action.

### Get Incident
- Fetches Incident data (all fields, related incident IDs, as well as external alert data) and returns it in JSON format. This is useful for posting to a CIP HTTP source (using 'Generic HTTP POST' action)
