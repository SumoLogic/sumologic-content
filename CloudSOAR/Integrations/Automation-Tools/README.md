# Automation Tools

## Whats included:
1. Integration YAML File
2. Action YAML Files (Refer to "Action Descriptions" section below for details)

This integration is in active development. Actions, or the parameters defined therin may change in subsequent releases.

## To use the content:

- Add any Actions you downloaded to that Integration by selecting the Upload icon (hover over the newly added integration), and uploading the Action YAML file(s).
- For more information on uploading custom Integrations/Actions and how to test them, please see [Working with integrations](https://help-opensource.sumologic.com/docs/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-integration-framework/#working-with-integrations).

## Action Descriptions
### Data Transform
- Provides various functions to more easily transform data in a playbook:
  - **String Input** - The value to transform.
  - **Transform Function** - Which string operation to use. Valid options are 'Split', 'Strip', 'Replace' or 'Regex'
      - **Split**: Splits a string into an array based on the delimiter provided in the "Transform Argument" parameter.
      - **Strip**: Removes leading and trailing characters from a string. Space is the default character to remove, unless specified otherwise in the "Transform Argument" parameter.
      - **Append**: Attaches a string to the end of a string (String Input > Transform Argument)
      - **Prepend**: Attaches a string to the beginning of a string (Transform Argument > String Input)
      - **Replace**: Replace a specified string/word/character with the value specified in the "Transform Argument" parameter.
      - **Regex**: Match a string with a regex pattern (python regex). Currently, this will return only the first capture group/match in an array. Could be further modified to accept an array num input.
  - **Transform Argument** - Function input (e.g. regex pattern (w/ capture groups), replace argument (a,b) or split delimiter).
  - **Array Element** - Optional: if using 'split' function, select the element to return. Otherwise return the entire array.
  
### Data Transform V2
- Same Functionality as Data Transform but adds an additional input field for Replace. This allows for user-provided value to be replace within the 'Transform Argument' and an user-provided value to be replace with in the 'Replace Argument'. Customers were having issues with the replace function when the character they wanted to replace was a ','.

### Filter IP Addresses
- Check a single IP, or list of IPs, and return a filtered list of IPs (sort into public IP and private IP lists).

### Signal Filter
-  Deconstructs a CSE Insight based on an assigned filter in order to retrieve specific field elements from the Signal Array that match the criteria.

### Deduplicate List
-  Allows you to deduplicate a list of values.

### Generate Password
- Generates a random password. Length and character makeup are configurable.

### Get Time
- Fetches the current time
  - Optionally returns the time elapsed from "now" when provided a timestamp to compare the current time with.

### Check Time Boundaries
- Evaluates whether the current time is within business hours. Configurable start and end times. 24-hour format.

### Check Time Boundaries V2
- ALlows an event time input value and evaluates whether that time is within business hours. Configurable start and end times. 24-hour format. Can input different time formats (including Epoch) for the event time and select the timezone of the event (default is UTC).

### Chunk Unix Timestamps
- Evaluates two timestamps and chunks the timestamps based on the chunk value. Ex: Two timestamps (1 year apart) with 1 month chunks, will output 12 chunks

### Build JSON Object
- Provide the action with JSON key placeholder or string to build a new JSON object with the specified key/values.

### Buffer
- Takes a JSON string, or object and returns it as a JSON result. Helpful for dumping a JSON blob in string format and rendering in JSON format.

### Sleep
- Adds a configurable wait time to the execution of a playbook.

### Get Time
- Returns the current time and provides an option to compare this time to a user-provided timestamp, returning elapsed time.

### Add Prefix Suffix
- This action will allow a user to pass an input string and add a prefix and/or a suffix
  
### Escape String
- Escapes Input Strings that contain specific special characters

### Extract Domain from URL
- Extract the root domain from a URL

### Extract Domain from Email Address
- Extract the root domain from an email address

### Add External Alert to Incident
- Takes a JSON payload and attaches to a Cloud SOAR incident's "External Alert" section.

### Get External Alert
- Fetches the external alert(s) attached to an incident

  - _Note: You will need to specify yaml output mappings for each external alert you wish to fetch in order for this action to be usable within a playbook._

### Add Entity Metadata
- Searches for the specified entity object (IP, URL, etc.), locates the entity's ID first, and then adds a tag and/or description to this entity.

### Render TextArea Field
- Uses a _textarea_ field to build a string using dynamic placeholders.

### Get War Room Timeline
- Grabs the Incident's audit timeline and returns it in JSON format. This is useful for posting to a CIP HTTP source (using 'Generic HTTP POST' action)

### Generic HTTP POST
- Make a generic POST request.
- Usage:
  - **API URL** - The HTTP Endpoint to make the request to.
  - **Request Body as JSON** - a _textarea_ field to build a JSON result using placeholders.
  - **Request Body (output.raw JSON)** - accepts the raw JSON result from the output of a previous action.

### Get Incident
- Fetches Incident data (all fields, related incident IDs, as well as external alert data) and returns it in JSON format. This is useful for posting to a CIP HTTP source (using 'Generic HTTP POST' action)

### String Regex
- Searches for the specified regular expression pattern and identifies all occurences. 

### Validate JSON
- Takes a text field and validates if the input is a valid JSON. If it is not a valid JSON then out puts the error and the exact input that it tested.

### Build Signal Output
- Must be used after a Get Insight V2 action from the the Sumo Logic CSE integration and then takes all signals from the output and converts it into a formated signal output to be used (example the output has been used in an email, ticketing system, or a notes section of the CSOAR incident) You can choose to either exclude or include any CSE schema fields: https://github.com/SumoLogic/cloud-siem-content-catalog/blob/master/schema/full_schema.md

- Exlude fields take precedence over include fields

- Must add the field singals to the output section of the Get Insight V2 action from the the Sumo Logic CSE integration

### Build Signal Output Break Lines
- This is the same as the Build Signal Output, but replaces break lines with new lines and properly escapes special characters to be used in a JSON value.

### Check Internal IP
- Allows an input of an IP or IP range to check weather it is internal or an external IP. Allows for additional user-provided IP's or ranges that should be classify as internal.
