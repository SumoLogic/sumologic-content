  "review":"This app gives me a nice breakdown of vulnerabilities by severity in my environment and provides nice info into the details of the findings. Sumo also has a Tenable.io source OOTB that makes collection seamless. It would be nice to be able to install this directly into my library, rather than having to download and import the json."
